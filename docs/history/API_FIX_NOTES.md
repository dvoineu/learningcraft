# API Routes Fix - Important Notes

## Issue Fixed
API routes were initially created in `src/app/[locale]/api/` which caused 404 errors because Next.js API routes should be in `src/app/api/` (not locale-specific).

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved API Routes
All API routes moved from `src/app/[locale]/api/` to `src/app/api/`:

- âœ… `src/app/api/user/quizzes/route.ts`
- âœ… `src/app/api/user/stats/route.ts`
- âœ… `src/app/api/quiz/[id]/route.ts`
- âœ… `src/app/api/quiz/[id]/attempts/route.ts`

### 2. Simplified Query in `/api/user/quizzes`
Changed from complex join query to simple query with separate lookups:

**Before** (caused errors):
```typescript
.select(`
  id, title, subject, difficulty, created_at,
  questions:questions(count),
  quiz_attempts!inner(score, total_questions, percentage, completed_at)
`)
```

**After** (works correctly):
```typescript
.select('id, title, subject, difficulty, created_at')
// Then fetch questions and attempts separately for each quiz
```

### 3. API Endpoints Now Working

All endpoints are accessible at:
- `GET /api/user/quizzes` - List user's quizzes
- `GET /api/user/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/quiz/[id]` - Quiz details
- `GET /api/quiz/[id]/attempts` - Quiz attempt history
- `DELETE /api/quiz/[id]` - Delete quiz

## Testing

Test API endpoints:
```bash
# Should return "Unauthorized" (correct behavior when not logged in)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/quizzes

# Should return "Unauthorized"
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/stats
```

## Important Notes

1. **API routes are NOT locale-specific** - They are in `/api/`, not `/[locale]/api/`
2. **Client-side code** in dashboard page correctly calls `/api/user/quizzes` (no locale prefix)
3. **Authentication** is handled by Supabase cookies, works across all locales
4. **No database schema changes needed** - All tables already exist

## Next Steps

1. âœ… API routes fixed and working
2. âœ… Dashboard page updated with better error handling
3. âœ… Documentation updated with correct paths
4. ðŸ”„ Test with actual user authentication
5. ðŸ”„ Create some test quizzes to verify full functionality

## Files Updated

- `src/app/api/user/quizzes/route.ts` - Simplified query
- `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx` - Better error handling
- `DASHBOARD_FEATURE.md` - Updated API paths
- `FR-7_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated file locations
